    "Exploratory data analysis consists of the following major tasks, which we present linearly here because each task doesn't make much sense to do without the ones prior to it. However, in reality, you are going to constantly jump around from step to step.  You may want to do all the steps for a subset of the variables first. Or often, an observation will bring up a question you want to investigate and you'll branch off and explore to answer that question before returning down the main path of exhaustive EDA.\n",
