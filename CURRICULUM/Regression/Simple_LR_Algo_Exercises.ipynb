    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to build a simple linear regression algorithm from scratch. Linear regression is a very useful and simple to understand predicting values, given a set of training data. The outcome of regression is a best fitting line function, which, by definition, is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared errors. When plotted on a 2 dimensional coordinate system, the errors are the distance between the actual Y' and predicted Y' of the line. In machine learning, this line equation Y' = b(x) + A is solved using gradient descent to gradually approach to it. **We will be using the statistical approach here that directly solves this line equation without using an iterative algorithm.**"
